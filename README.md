# Japanese-Car-Price-Predictions
Kubicle Project on supervised machine learning using python. Helping a Japanese car company re-enter the US market after a failed attempt due to pricing issues.

A Japanese car company has hired me to help them enter the US market after a failed attempt. For the first attempt, the company based pricing of cars on previous experience in the Japanese market.

Customers in the US found the car prices were too high and as a result, were not buying them. The company, Akashi, has asked me to build a regression model based on a dataset of cars for sale in the US.

They want to use this model to predict the most appropriate price for the cars they're selling to the US.
